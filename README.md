📜 About This Project
This project is designed to help you track all SMS notifications related to debit and credit transactions. With this tool, you can:

📊 Track daily expenses effortlessly.
🎯 Set daily spending limits to control your expenditure.
👀 Monitor your expenses effectively for better financial awareness.

- I developed this project to solve a personal challenge. When I started using net banking and UPI transactions,
I often lost track of my daily spending. To address this issue, I created this tool for myself, and now I'm sharing it with the community by adding it to my repository.
